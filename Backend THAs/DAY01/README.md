<b> Lab | <b> Transportation Engineering
<b> Experiment|     <b> 1. Study of Spot Speed 

<h5> About the Lab (Objective) : </h5>

To determine the spot speed of a vehicle.

<h5> About the Experiment : </h5>

 Spot speed is the instantaneous speed of a vehicle at a specified location. Spot speed can be used to design the geometry of road like horizontal and vertical curves, super elevation etc. Location and size of signs, design of signals, safe speed, and speed zone determination, require the spot speed data.
